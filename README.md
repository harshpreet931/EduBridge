# 📚 Empowering Education for All: Next.js Project

Welcome to our **Next.js** project, dedicated to bringing quality education to underprivileged communities. Built using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), this project harnesses the power of modern web development to drive social impact through accessible learning. 🌍

## 🔑 Setting Up Your Environment

To get started, you'll need to configure the `keys.json` file in the root of the project. This allows us to connect with Infura for future blockchain-powered features:

```json
{
  "INFURA_PROJECT_ID": "#Your Infura Project ID",
  "MNEMONIC": "#Your account seed phrase for future contract deployment"
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Once everything is set up, follow these steps to launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.
